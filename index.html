<!--<table> </table> We can use this html codes to create a table that can
accommodate data on a webpage. Table html codes mirror our html codes. It has header,

</th>  </th> and table data (table cell) <td>  </td> in order to work
properly. Sample structure below:-->
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
	<tfoot>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tfoot>
</table>


<!-- Table html start with Table head <thead> </thead>, Table body <tbody>  </tbody>
and table foot <tfoot> </tfoot> it is great to structure table in this way
in order to have chances to style every part of a table differently-->

<!--<thead> </thead> This is called table head. We use it to indicate that table
is going to have a head -->

<!-- <tr> </hr> This is called table row. We use this to create a single
row on a table-->

<!-- <th> </th> This is called table header. we can use this to create header
for a table in order to structure the data on the table header differently
from the body data-->

<!--<td>  </td> This is called table data. We use these html code to put data
in the cell of our table -->
